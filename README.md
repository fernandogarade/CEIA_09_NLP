# CEIA_09_NLP
This repository was made during the 2021 NLP course of the AI Specialization at Universidad de Buenos Aires.
In 8 classes we did a review and practical implementation of the main techniques that have been used to solve NLP problems.


You will find 6 folders with a Colab notebook each that aims to show some of these approaches studied in the course.
- Clase 1: easy examples to show concepts like word2vec, corpus, bow, ohe, tf-idf vectors, cosine similarity
- Clase 2: simple rule-based chatbot for customer support.  
- Clase 3: creation of custom embeddings with gensim to represent text comparing results when using different music bands corpuses.
- Clase 4: creation of custom embeddings with Keras Embedding Layer and use of bidirectional layer to predict next word of a sequence based on Elon Musks tweets.
- Clase 5: ecommerce clothing reviews sentiment analysis using embeddings and LSTM. Use of FastText embeddings.
- Clase 6: Questions & Answers Bot built with LSTM, Glove embeddings and Seq2Seq prediction.


Although not impressive results were achieved during these examples, I hope you could find them in someway useful to get inspired and build great projects!
