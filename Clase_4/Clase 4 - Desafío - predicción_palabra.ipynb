sideways right before landing Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard Reviewing telemetry gilleran True but that s a minor factor for rockets No but shielding got fragged every flight More control authority is for Falcon Heavy but also enable They will but the hydraulic system is closed loop so no fluid lost They do need more power energy but Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups Flying with larger significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins Single piece cast cut titanium Can take reentr Sticking to 100 It

team every day Tesla customers are v smart don t want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot Recent poll 0 0 want it disabled not 0 1 0 0 It can at moderate range but our ultrasonics are very good at human or anything water density detection Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon Doesn t need to be so loud Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled Was written with zero input from us K Berg That is a very good point Have to focus on tonight s launch Will post Tesla master product plan afterwards Btw want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their

sample size More software mods and data may be needed beyond that Blog on Autopilot by US is 11 deaths per billion miles WW is 17 deaths per billion Autopilot already much better than either so far Unless we get there and find it isn t enough Just won t be before 1B It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet However there is no substitute for real world experience With less than 1B miles there simply isn t enough data 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition Thanks Point of calling it beta was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn t perfect CraigR exactly that wasn t criticism just clarification why thought I was posting Reuters Copied the wrong link Probably six months Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot you re right no point Use of word beta is explicitly so that drivers don t get comfortable It is not beta software in the standard sense Misunderstanding of what beta means to Tesla

mentioned at the beginning of the year I m expecting 70 success rate on landings for the year 2016 is the year of experimentation Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines Thanks Tyler Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today Maybe hardest impact to date Droneship still ok Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing

they don t last long or there are a lot of aliens Yeah that matches what we ve found so far More likely unhinged than nefarious Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed Q is why Of greater concern 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent i e false location or vehicle identification numbers were used

Sorry to hear that Will take care of this investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic So it was good for you too Fast replay of today s rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY Very similar The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings but needs to be replaced after hard Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator Easy to replace if Falcon makes it back to port Rocket landing speed was close to design max used up contingency crush core hence back forth motion Prob ok but some risk of tipping Satellite deployed to 91 000 km apogee All looks good 3 mins to launch There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator Probably not a flight risk but still worth investigating RT Weather 90 go for 5

took advantage of low cost labor We paid 55 hr That is unequivocal We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of but less less of the Merc story appears to be true Merc News story about Tesla using 5 hr labor seems to be missing a digit Tesla actually paid 55 hr Canada Totally agree Am told this will be fixed by Thurs maybe Fri Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs

vehicle will be metric next month with a lot of other good stuff exactly andyoneal sides def center maybe naturally Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5 1M lbf at liftoff twice any rocket currently flying It s a beast F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1 71M lbf later this year It is capable of 1 9M lbf in flight F9 LEO payload on capabilities page correct figure on main page should be 22 800 kg No cross feed It would help performance but is not needed for these numbers No physical changes to the engine This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests It is just tougher than we thought Max performance numbers are for expendable launches Subtract 30 to 40 for reusable booster payload Basically current but higher throttle setting Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy yes RT hm turns out it doesn t need securing Elon yes yes several times for sure things like this should be

do that now with S and X Will be same for 3 elombardo correct hopefully 0 21 what s the link to that No but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity no problem Will cover whole country hopefully this year yes but production AWD will be a lot faster less torque is shifted between front rear motors every 01 secs Traction control is way better than a normal AWD Digital vs analog And of course it will have more cowbells Model 3 will be RWD with dual motor AWD optional Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque

causing it RT First stage approaches center of landing droneship in Pacific penguin OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage but payload would be greatly reduced Actually didn t get environmental approval in time but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed If speed at stage separation 6000 km hr With a ship no need to zero out lateral velocity so can stage at up to 9000 km h Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs Just not physically possible to return to launch site As mentioned before ship landings are needed for high velocity missions Altitude distance don t mean much for orbit All about speed steel collet Well at least the pieces were bigger this time Won t be last RUD but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing Gus probably However that was not what prevented it being good Touchdown speed was ok but a leg lockout didn t latch so it tipped over after landing Definitely harder to land on
